# COMP2300/6300 lab-pack-4 template repo

This contains the lab weekly repos for:
   - [10-network-connections](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/labs/10-network-connections/)
   - [11-c-language](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/labs/11-c-language/)
   - [12-diy-operating-system](https://cs.anu.edu.au/courses/comp2300/labs/12-diy-operating-system/)

## VSCode Instructions

Once you've forked and cloned this repo, you must make sure to open the `week-N` sub-folders in VSCode (where N is the current week), not the whole lab-pack repository.  
You can do this in VSCode by doing:  
- `File -> Open Folder... -> week-X.`  

If you don't open a sub-folder, the COMP2300 VSCode extension won't know how to build your code.
